# Project OUVER /BLA


AR Monocle and app to bring subs to deaf persons

OUVER comes from the portuguese "ouvir" (to listen) plus "ver" (to see).
It aims to create a affordable AR Monocle that together with a APP, will show in real time subtitles of the world.
At the moment we are able to convert speech and we are working now to be able to show emergency and hazardous sounds like car hornings, falling objects, between others.

It has a companion device called Bla that is a special micro wireless keyboard that does the inverse so mute or people with vocalization problem are able to communicate verbally. This device can be used in standalone.

We want to make this project as a DIY solution so it can be made easily by who needs and at the same time set the bar for the prices of sets that will appear made industrially.

Centralizing the project will help keep quality up and garantee a giant network working for the same goal.
