Online version has all functions and support for the wireless device and Bla.
It uses the Android voice to text service that doesn't support continuous recognition.
Because of that during silent moment the service restarts wich can make it miss the first words.

Offline version uses the final recognition engine we intent to use. At this moment it uses a small 
Model for testing purposes. The current model is under 150mb and it's available in 6 languages. You should set the language first and if it's not English you should wait for it to download it.
It will warm you when it's over.
We intent as soon as possible to release RC1 with this engine and all functions together.
If you are a android programmer and wish to help, you are more than welcome.
